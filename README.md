# Coos-Bay-NERRS-Project-2016-2020
Data collected during our NERRS Science Collaborative project in the Coos estuary during 2016-2019. These data include water property profiles (Temp, salinity, turbidity) and grain size data from seafloor grab samples. 

Three main types of data are here:
1) CTD profiles: These are profiles of temperature, salinity, and turbidity as a function of depth at locations across the estuary and over time. 

2) Grain sizes: These are distribution of grain size (as % in certain size classes) taken from grab samples of the seafloor in the Coos estuary. 

3) Hydrodynamic model output: See Conroy et al. 2019 or Eidam et al. 2020 for a description of the model. These data are not provided here as they are too large (>20 TB), but are available upon request. Instead, we refer you to the above papers for a description of the simulations and output.
